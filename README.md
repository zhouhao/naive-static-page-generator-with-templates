### Background

In the past, to streamline my website development process, I often purchased well-designed HTML templates online.
However, I encountered a challenge when building product landing pages: most pages shared the same header and footer.
This posed a potential issue for future maintenance, as updating headers and footers across multiple static pages would
be time-consuming and labor-intensive.

To address this concern and reduce future maintenance work, I developed a simple yet effective generator. This tool
allows me to:

1. Maintain a single source for headers and footers
2. Automatically apply these common elements across multiple pages
3. Easily update all pages by modifying just one source file
